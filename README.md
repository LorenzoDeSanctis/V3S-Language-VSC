# Visual 3D Pipeline Script Syntax Highlighting for Visual Studio Code

This Visual Studio Code extension provides syntax highlighting for the Visual 3D Pipeline Script (.v3s) language, a procedural scripting language used to automate tasks in Visual 3D Pipeline. The extension supports the following features:

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Keywords, function names, parameters, and comments are highlighted for easier reading and editing.
  - Functions: Declared with capitalized names (e.g., `File_Open`).
  - Parameters: Start with a `/` (e.g., `/FILE_NAME=`).
  - Comments: Begin with an exclamation mark `!`.
  - Function termination: Indicated by a semicolon `;`.
  
## Usage

Open any `.v3s` file in Visual Studio Code to see the syntax highlighting automatically applied.
